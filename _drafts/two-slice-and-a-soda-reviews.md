As I mentioned in a previous post, I thoroughly enjoy a cheap slice of pizza when I'm out and about. Whether I'm running late home from work and need a quick dinner or if I'm in a part of NYC I've never been to and need a quick meal, I am always down to get some pizza. In this post, I'll detail out a pizza rating system then rate some pizza shops I've been to so far.

## Needlessly complex pizza shop scoring system

I can't make this too simple, so I've got to make up my own system for rating pizzashops. This rating system is inspired by the MEC rating system for board games from a podcast I listen to, [Fantasy and Some Flights](https://www.fantasyandsomeflights.com/post/e3-the-spectrum-of-games-the-mec-system). The main pillars of the pizza shop rating system are vibe, ingredients, and overall value. These are all weighted on a 1-10 scale, then weighted based on personal preference to arrive at a final score out of ten.

My personal weightings are 25% vibe, 30% ingredients, and 45% overall value.
