Check out the article I wrote on improving code-confidence in a large-scale flutter application by integration testing. It has been a fun experience learning all the edges flutter testing has.

I'm interested in writing more on testing in flutter, so reach out to me with any areas you'd like to hear about. Recently I've been wrestling with testing views with network images and precaching images. I'd also like to learn more about golden testing, so that is another possibility as well.
