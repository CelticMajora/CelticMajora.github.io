It's about time I made a personal site. Sitting home today watching an ExtraLife charity stream and finally decided to get around to it. So here it is, all spun up whilst watching Stephen Georg and crew play shovelware from the North America Wii library.

Hi, I'm CelticMajora, and I'll be using this site to talk about projects I'm working on, hobbies I pursue, and other random topics. Outside of posts talking about what I do, I'll also just use this as a hub linking out things I do.

## Software Engineering

As of writing, I am working as a software engineer at Betterment(obligatory all thoughts on this site are my own, not employers), developing in the investing domain on their mobile application in Flutter. Outside of my domain, I've focused on our QA. Look forward to a future post that will link out to work I do associated with that(not yet public)

More generically, I've been researching static analysis tools in dart and occasionally dabbling in rails.

## Tabletop gaming

Currently primarily playing Pathfinder 2nd Edition with a couple groups of college friends. I'll post more on tabletop RPG preferences in the future, but glad to have migrated away from just D&D 5e. Other systems I'd like to try/play more often are Call of Cthulhu, Dungeon Crawl Classics, Cyberpunk Red, and Alien RPG.

As far as board games go, Dominion has been my go-to recently. Others I've been playing are Wingspan and The Taverns of Tiefenthal.

## Eating the foods of NYC

After moving to NYC in Jaunary of this year, I've been taking advantage of the amazing food scene. So far, my favorites food activities have been visiting the Queens Night Market and realizing it is way too late for a meal only to find the closest pizza-by-the-slice counter to try their two cheese slices and a soda deal.
